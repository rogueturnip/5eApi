# 5eAPI

This is an express REST API and GraphQL server to serve up data stored in a mongodb (https://github.com/rogueturnip/5eImport) for the 5e.tools JSON structure.

Currently there is limited Parsing of the data but with a query parameter of "raw=true" the full JSON can be returned.

## ToDo

- GraphQL completion
- Complete Models
- Complete conversion to TypeGoose
- Expand Models with better typing

### Thanks to the team at 5e.tools for a great data set to work with!
